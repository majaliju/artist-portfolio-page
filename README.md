## **ABOUT**
As a musical artist (or a creative person in any endeavor), one needs a centralized source (such as a website) to present information to current fans and prospective fans. 
I needed such a page for myself so I built a simple one, based on React!

## **WHERE?**
[placehold text here](majaliju.com)

## **TOOLS**
Some of the tools I used on this were:
[React, for the app](https://reactjs.org/)
[ChakraUI, for the UI and extra features] (https://chakra-ui.com/)
[Heroku, for the backend deployment] (https://heroku.com/)
[Netlify, for the production] (https://www.netlify.com/)

## BLOG
[I wrote about this process recently and all that it put me through, both in a hard and rewarding way.] (https://medium.com/@majalijunyc/phase-2-the-terrible-silver-lining-of-deployment-production-c9153cc9118)
