## **ABOUT**
As a musical artist (or a creative person in any endeavor), one needs a centralized source (such as a website) to present information to current fans and prospective fans. 
I needed such a page for myself so I built a simple one, based on React!

## **WHERE?**
[You can find it at my website here!](https://majaliju.com/)

## **TOOLS**
Some of the tools I used on this were:

[React, for the app](https://reactjs.org/)

[Chakra UI, for UI & extra features](https://chakra-ui.com/)

[Heroku, for backend deployment](https://heroku.com/)

[Netlify, for the production](https://www.netlify.com/)


## BLOG
[I wrote about this process recently and all that it put me through, both in a hard and rewarding way](https://medium.com/@majalijunyc/phase-2-the-terrible-silver-lining-of-deployment-production-c9153cc9118)
